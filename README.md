# HEMCODE Blog

This is the blog all about software engineering, spefically Leetcoding and coding problems interview style! My whole journey will be documentated using my open-sourced app (feel free to clone and use it too!) 

## To get started:

- git clone https://github.com/Hemit99123/hemcode.git
- npm install
- npm run dev

## To contribute

- Branch out from main to avoid pushing broken code to prod
- Create PR to merge to prod once you are confident with your code!
